# fix the code given

# original code to be fixed:
# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#   print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# expected output should be:
# Day 1 - String Manipulation
# String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
# e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
# New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

# the fixed code
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
